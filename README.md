# C2C Fashion Marketplace Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the **Global C2C Fashion Store User Behaviour Analysis** dataset, originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-c2c-fashion-store-user-behaviour-analysis). The project aims to uncover insights into seller behavior, product categories, pricing patterns, and marketplace dynamics within a customer-to-customer (C2C) fashion platform.

## Project Highlights

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering for brand, price ranges, and user types  
- Grouped analysis of seller behaviors, pricing distributions, and brand/category relationships  
- Visualization of marketplace trends, including power seller contribution and top brands  

## Key Insights

- **Pricing**: The majority of listings fall under a certain price threshold, with luxury items contributing to a long tail in the price distribution.
- **Power Sellers**: A small group of sellers generate a significant proportion of total listings.
- **Brand & Category Trends**: A few global fashion brands dominate, and women's fashion categories are the most commonly listed.
- **Listing Attributes**: Product condition and shipping options have a visible effect on pricing and sale likelihood.
